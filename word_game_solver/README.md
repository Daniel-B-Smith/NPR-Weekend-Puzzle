# Word Game Solver

This is a CLI for solving a pretty simple word game. The rules of the game are
such:

* The player chooses a 5 letter word without any repeated letters.
* The solver is going to attempt to guess that word.
* Every time the solver guesses a word, type in the number of letters in common
between the guess and the selected word.

That's basically it.
